        <p> My favorite hobby is cooking. When we are free, me and my mom will head to the kitchen to go whip up some snacks.
            <br>
            Learning and developing food skills is very important. If there is no one to cook for you, and you can't get takeout, what will you do?
            <br>
            Well, that's where the cooking comes in. If you can create incredible dishes, your guests will be amazed! And cooking is an awesome career, too!
            <br>
            If you decide to become a culinary artist, you may get the chance to get on TV, and cook for famous personalities.
            You may even become one yourself!
            <br>
            That's why I like to cook. The next time you're in your kitchen, try making an exquisite meal. Who knows? Maybe you'll become a Michelin Star award-winning chef!
